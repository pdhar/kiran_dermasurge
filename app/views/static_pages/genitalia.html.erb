		The hymen tissue is pulled together so vagina will again cover by it. The risk of fever and infection is low since hymen is relatively avascular.

	<h3>Vaginoplasty</h3>

	<p>
		For women who've experienced multiple childbirths, vaginal muscles tend to experience enlargement due to stressful expansion during the delivery.
		The result can often be loose, weak, vaginal muscles. Even after exercise (Kegal), the condition of the vaginal muscles may not improve. Many women
		find that while the experience of childbirth may be the most rewarding of their lives, sometimes the after effects for both their sexual partner and
		themselves is not as satisfying as it once was.
	</p>

	<p>
		Vaginoplasty, sometimes referred to as rejuvenation of the vagina, is a procedure that can usually correct the problem of stretched vaginal muscles
		resulting from childbirth(s), and is a direct means of enhancing one's sexual life once again. The procedure typically tones vaginal muscle, resulting
		in greater contraction strength and control, thereby permitting greater sensation during sexual experiences.
	</p>
	<p>
		Generally, anyone in average physical condition or good health can be a candidate for vaginoplasty surgery.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Procedure and Recovery?</strong>
		<br />
		Vaginoplasty is a standard gynecologic surgical procedure. It tightens vaginal muscles and surrounding soft tissues, by reducing excess vaginal mucosa
		(vaginal lining). The result is an immediate decrease in the size of vaginal muscles, resulting in more friction during sexual experiences.

	<p>
		After surgery, the patient is usually able to walk comfortably within a few days and may return to sexual activities within 4-6 weeks.
	</p>

	<p>
		Surgical risks are few, but may include among others: infection, bleeding, and scarring.
	</p>

	<h3>Labioplasty</h3>
	<p>
		Labiaplasty also referred to as labioplasty, is a surgical procedure that will reduce and/or reshape the labia minora - the skin that covers the
		female clitoris and vaginal opening. In some instances, women with large labia can experience pain during intercourse, or feel discomfort during everyday
		activities or when wearing tight-fitting clothing. Others may feel unattractive, or wish to enhance their sexual experiences by removing some of the skin
		that covers the clitoris. The purpose of a labiaplasty is to better define the inner labia. During this
		the urethral opening can be redefined,
		and if necessary improvements to the vagina may be made. The problem can be caused by genetics, sexual intercourse or difficulties in childbirth
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Labia Minora (inner lips) Reduction - </strong>Many women dislike the large protuberant appearance of their labia minora. This may cause
		severe embarrassment with a sexual partner. The overly large labia minora can also result in constant irritation in tight pants. Surgical labial
		reduction can greatly improve the aesthetic appearance of the abnormally enlarged labis. Some women are born with large labia, others may develop
		this condition with childbirth or age.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Labia Majora (outer lips) Reduction - </strong>This common anatomical variation may be worsened by childbirth or by weight gain or loss.
		They may sometimes be improved by liposuction. In more severe cases, surgical reduction is necessary.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Best Candidates:</strong>
		<br />
		Women who are either experiencing sexual dysfunction, embarrassment, or pain because their labia (labia minora) are over-sized or asymmetrical. Also,
		women who dislike their large labia or shape of their labia, which may cause inelegance or awkwardness with a sexual partner.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Length of Surgery:</strong>
		<br />
		1 to 2 hours
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Recovery:</strong>
		<br />
		Labiaplasty is an outpatient procedure usually performed under local anesthesia. After surgery, women may experience some mild discomfort and swelling,
		which usually disappears completely after 1-2 weeks. Labial incisions usually heal and are rarely noticeable.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Risks:</strong>
		<br />
		As with any surgical procedure there are certain risks. While few, the most common can include bleeding, infection, asymmetry, and scarring.
		Although these events are usually infrequent, they sometimes can occur. These will be discussed with you during the consultation for your procedure.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Back to Work:</strong>
		<br />
		3 to 5 days
	</p>

	<h3>Penile Girth Enlargement</h3>
	<p>
		When a guy is wondering whether he's big enough for his lady or maybe big enough to compare with other guys, he's certainly thinking in terms
		of length. That's what most men think about when the question "Am I big enough?" comes to mind because this is what they see as the most important
		feature of their penises. But is it really so? Is length more important than girth? Is it more important than technique and skill in bed? The really
		well-endowed guys like to think so, but the answer is not that simple.
	</p>

	<p>
		Length is fine, but girth is just as important for the lover who really knows what he's doing and if you want to be a winner in bed, you shouldn't
		just focus on the former at the expense of the latter. Fact is, all the nerve endings that send those delightful waves of pleasure to the brain are
		located within the vagina's first couple of inches. Naturally, that means that ladies are bound to like a penis that can really stretch those inches,
		especially if the man, that is you, knows how to use it. But what if you have a thin penis?
	</p>

	<p>
		Well, that's one problem that can be easily taken care of.
	</p>
	<p>
		Penis pumps or penis extenders are not of much use when it comes to girth because these devices are best suited for length. Sure, a
		penis extender will add something to your girth as well, because the body tries to maintain a minimum of balance between length and girth.
		I don't personally
		recommend penis pumps because I think they are too dangerous for any user; too many things can go wrong when using a pump. But penile girth
		enhancement is a good idea, one that I advise all interested men to look into as it can be done under local/regional anesthesia as a day care
		procedure with minimal down time.
