	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
		A clear glowing complexion with a radiant, healthy skin is what we all aspire for, but more often than not there are road blocks. Besides aging, stress, hormonal changes, there are several impediments under the sun that take a toll on your personal tapestry â€“ the skin.

		You are eager to have a facelift. Pause. Take time to decide where and how can you get the face you want? Today cosmetic surgeries and procedures are performed down the alley, at the mall, spa and any consumer oriented outlet. Worse still, these have evolved beyond the scrutiny of medical professionals/ personnels.
